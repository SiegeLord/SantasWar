1. Goal of the Game
===================
Snowball fight elves of the opposite color team to win!

2. Controls
===========
Arrow Keys - Move your character
Left/Right Ctrl - Construct a snowball
Space - Prepare to launch a snowball (release to fire)
Esc - Quit

3. Playing the game
===================

First, pick a name (limited to 10 characters) by selecting the name menu item
and typing a name.

To host a game, first choose a level by selecting the level menu item and using
the left/right arrow keys to select a level. Then, select the match duration
by selecting the match duration menu item and using the left/right arrow keys to
select the duration. After you are satisfied with the settings, select the host
game menu item and hit enter.

To join a game, select the join game menu item and type the address of the server
you want to connect to. This can be an IP address or a hostname. Hit enter when
you are done.

By default Santa's War uses UDP port 1024 so make sure it is open. You can alter
it by editing the options.cfg file.

Edit the options.cfg file to enable fullscreen mode. 

4. Building
===========

Use the provided Makefiles with a DMDFE 2.060 compiler. On 32 bit linux dmd works
best, on 64 bit linux LDC2 works best. On Windows dmd works best. You'll also need
Allegro5.1, DAllegro, TangoD2, enet, Denet and SLConfig.

I suggest you use the binaries I provide.
